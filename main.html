    <h1>Progress bar</h1>
    <p>1. Introduction

A progress bar is a visual UI (user interface) element that shows the completion status of a task over time. It helps users understand how much work has been done, how much remains, and sometimes how long it might take. Progress bars are commonly used in software installations, file downloads, loading screens, and form submissions.<br>

<br>2. Purpose and Importance

Progress bars serve several key purposes:
User feedback – They reassure users that a process is running.
Time perception – Tasks feel faster when progress is visible.
Reduced frustration – Users are less likely to think an app has frozen.
Decision-making – Users can decide whether to wait or cancel a task.
Without progress indicators, users may become confused or impatient, especially during long operations.</p>
